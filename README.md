# VexRiscv with AXI RAM
The purpose of this project is to use bare metal C code to access AXI RAM via the VexRiscv processor. All the RTL required for the project is in the RTL directory whereas the files required to generate .hex file for verilog to read from can be found in the bare_metal_stimulus directory. Use a compatible riscv-toolchain to build the main.c as described in the makefile. Then elf2hex command can be used to convert the formed .elf into readable .hex file for the Verilog to read from. There is also a PDF in this repository with a block diagram for what the system looks like on a macro level.
Change the main.c to your liking to access different memory addresses of the AXI RAM.
